<img src= photos/IMG_2791.jpeg width="700">

I am a professional Mining Engineer-in-Training. I hold a Bachelors of Applied Science in Mining Engineering, as well as a minor in Data Science from the University of British Columbia. Throughout school, I've acquired 2 years of engineering-related work experience in surface and underground operations and have done a research term in mineral processing under the supervision of Dr. Bern Klein and his PhD candidate (at the time) Giovanni Pamparana. I am currently a Short Range Planner at U.S. Steel Corporation.
