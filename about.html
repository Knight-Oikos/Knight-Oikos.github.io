        WORK EXPERIENCE
    </h2>

    <h3>
        United States Steel Corporation (Current)
    </h3>

    <p>
        I am currently a Mining Engineer at <a href = "https://www.ussteel.com/">U.S. Steel</a> involved in short-range mine planning; 
        planning mine operations on the daily to monthly interval. I work with fellow engineers, geologists and operators to schedule the sequencing of earth excavation,
        plan material haulage, and design the pit development.

    </h3>

    <p>
        I was with <a href = "https://ascotgold.com/">Ascot</a>'s Premier Mine as a Mining Engineering Co-op for 8 months from January to August of 2024. I gained work experience in multiple
        facets of mining, from field work such as underground surveying, geotechnical QA/QC, ventilation monitoring all the way to technical aspects such as designing underground drifts, 
        drafting prints of ground support standards, forming plans to improve ventilation, and managing the production database to summarize key performance indicators. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Even though Premier started back in 1918 and closed
        in 2001, I was there to experience the development of a mine from the ground floor after Ascot started it back up again in 2020. Not many mining engineers
        get such an opportunity to work during the conception of a mine, which is different than working in one already in production. In a 
        developing mine, I found that the environment was more fast-paced and volatile. Mine plans could change multiple times during the day, and we had to troubleshoot
        a lot of infrastructural and logistical problems on our own. Despite all that, I found the work to be very rewarding. The main reason was because it was exciting. Every day
        had different challenges that would teach me something new, no matter if it was technical knowledge or how I could improve upon my soft skills. Substantially, I felt that I learned just as much
        as I did, working at Suncor for 16 months. The people I worked with were talented, passionate, and showed great cohesion as a team. The beauty of the site didn't hurt
        as well.

    <h3>
        Suncor Energy Inc. (May 2022 - Aug 2023)
    </h3>

    <p>
        I was at Suncor's Syncrude Aurora North site for 16 months, working in oil sands operations as a Mining Engineer Co-op. 
        I was mainly in the mine planning division and rotated through 3 roles: shovel planning, roads planning, and structures planning.

        
    </p>

    <p>
        As a shovel planning student, I managed the daily excavation plan for ore and waste across 9 electric and 2 hydraulic shovels. Through collaboration with 
        engineers, geologists and operations leaders, I planned where the shovel would dig, the limits that it would dig up to, and precautions that should be taken to mitigate
        sloughing in the dig face. To understand dig limits, I analyzed geology and cross sections to classify the material as ore or waste as well as keeping sufficient width
        for the shovel to load trucks in double backup for optimal productivity. In areas where geology is challenging to manage unwanted clay content, I would design CAD surfaces on MicroStation and upload them to
        the shovel's system for the operator to follow. To manage geological discontinuities such as faults, I would guide the shovel on the direction that it would dig based on rose plots.
        I indicate operationally specific instructions for different conditions such as 'raking the face' when weather is cold making the material harder to mine, 
        'split facing' for hydraulic shovels in a dig face that is half-ore half-waste, and staying above a certain elevation level to avoid water or soft oil-sand rich ground 
        that would risk the shovel getting stuck. I would say that shovel planning was the best place to start out for mine planning experience and provided a good base for,
        the subsequent roles I did.
    </p>

    <p>
        I spent another 3 months in structures planning, monitoring material placement towards dumps and in-pit structures. I had become familiar already with waste locations
        and was able to collaborate with the shovels division and form plans to route the appropriate material for the construction. I expanded my geotechnical
        expertise by learning about the components of tailings dykes as well as the construction process and protocols. To monitor placement, I would track progress 
        on Wenco, conduct daily field tours, cross reference the MicroStation design with Avenza Maps, and facilitate open communication between operators for feedback to optimally execute the task. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I spent the remainder of my term in roads planning. I planned and managed haul roads that provide the foundation for transportation between load and dump points. 
        Similar to the previous roles, I conduct daily field tours to form plans for road 
        maintenance, identifying the cause of uneven roads and allocating more grader effort on those areas or replacing a section with more competent material.
        Using my knowledge from shovels and structures planning, I was able to strategically plan routes that would be the most productive such as looking for straight
        shots across turns that didn't make sense, initiating the construction of ramps for shorter hauls, and keeping ahead of the shovel forecast to plan new routes
        replacing old ones that would be dug out. My most rewarding project I have done was designing and monitoring the construction of a semi-permanent limestone road
        from conception. I was mentored by an experienced operations leader and learned about the necesary equipment to do the job, material specifications that would pass 
        as competent material, the geotechnical standards that must be met, and the procedures to be done in order to meet these standards.
        It was really rewarding for me as a Co-op student at the time to be responsible for such a large project and taught me a lot about project management,
        teamwork, and geotechnical design.

        EDUCATION
    </h2>
    <h3>
        University of British Columbia (Sep 2019 - May 2025)
    </h3>

    <p>
        I hold a Bachelors of Applied Science in Mining Engineering with a Minor in Data Science from the University of British Columbia. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The standard engineering program consists of completing a general engineering first year and then specializing in your intended engineering discipline (which for me was mining) in years
        2 to 4. The standard completion time is 4 years but students can choose to extend their degree by a year (or more) to enroll in the Co-operative Education Program and complete
        work terms in between academics with various engineering companies that enhance the learning experience. During the last year, students complete a capstone project
        that aims to approach and recommend solutions for a real world problem presented by an engineering company.
    </p>

    <p>
        In my program, I studied a breadth of facets in the mining industry such as Underground and Surface Mine Design, Engineering Geology, Rock Mechanics, Tailings Management,
        Mine Ventilation, Mining Equipment, Mineral Processing, and Engineering Economics. I gained additional quantitative exposure from my minor in data science in aspects such 
        Machine Learning, Mathematical Optimization, Statistical Modelling and Relational Databases. I chose to do 2 years of co-op to gain experience in both
        open pit and underground mines, making me well rounded to work at different mines across the world. My capstone project was sponsored by Teck Resources Ltd.
